# GPTerminal

GPTerminal is an experimental script that allows the GPT-4o-mini model to have direct control over a user's computer via the terminal. This project is designed to explore the capabilities and limitations of AI models when interacting with a system's command line interface.

**Warning:** This script is **not safe** to run directly on your primary computer! The model could execute unintended commands that may harm your system. It is strongly recommended to run this script within a secure virtual machine (VM). GPTerminal has been tested inside Debian Linux but should work on any system with a Bash shell and the required dependencies (see prerequisites below).

## Prerequisites

Before running GPTerminal, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Bash shell** (most Unix-like systems have this by default)
- **curl**: Command-line tool for transferring data with URLs
- **jq**: Command-line JSON processor
- **OpenAI API Key**: You need an API key with access to the GPT-4o-mini model

To check if `curl` and `jq` are installed, you can run:

```bash
curl --version
jq --version
```

If they are not installed, you can install them using your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl jq
```

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Script**

   Save the script to a file called `gpterminal.sh`.

2. **Make the Script Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x gpterminal.sh
   ```

3. **Set Your OpenAI API Key**

   Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

   Replace `"your-api-key-here"` with your actual API key.

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
./gpterminal.sh
```

You will be prompted to enter a task for the model:

```plaintext
Please enter the task for the model:
```

Type in the task you want the model to perform and press **Enter**. The script will then enter a loop where it communicates with the GPT-4o-mini model, receives commands, executes them, and feeds the output back to the model until the task is complete or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Prompting**

   The script starts by sending an initial prompt to the GPT-4o-mini model, instructing it that it has control over the terminal and should output commands to achieve the specified task.

2. **Command Execution Loop**

   - The model generates a command based on the task and previous outputs.
   - The script executes the command in the terminal.
   - The output of the command is captured and sent back to the model.
   - This loop continues until the model outputs `TASKCOMPLETE3939` or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

3. **Termination**

   - If the model signals that the task is complete, the script exits gracefully.
   - If the maximum number of iterations is reached without completion, the script notifies the user.

## Security Warning

**Important:** This script executes commands generated by an AI model directly on your system. This can be extremely dangerous for the following reasons:

- The model may generate commands that can delete files, modify system settings, or perform other harmful operations.
- The model does not have a built-in understanding of system security and may unintentionally execute malicious commands.

**Recommendations:**

- **Run in a Virtual Machine:** Always run this script in a secure VM isolated from your host system.
- **Network Isolation:** Consider disabling network access within the VM to prevent the model from downloading malicious content or communicating externally.
- **Use Snapshots:** Take a snapshot of your VM before running the script so you can easily revert any changes.

## License

This project is for experimental purposes and does not have a specific license. Use it at your own risk.

---

**Note:** While GPTerminal has been tested on Debian Linux, it should run on other Unix-like systems that have a Bash shell and the required dependencies (`curl` and `jq`). However, differences in system environments may lead to unexpected behavior. Always exercise caution and thoroughly test in a controlled environment.
